# CleaningDataProject
Final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data R Course on Coursera

Relevant files in repo: run_analysis.R

Creation Date: Feb 28th, 2016

The run_analysis.R file contains the required code to set up the data as required by the course instructions.

The two relevant output tables created are:

    merged_means_std: output dataset with merged data for test and train sets containint the means and standard deviations of the different variables
    
    summary: output dataset with the data from merged_means_std summarized by means for each variable and grouped by activity and subject
    
*All other output files were used only for intermediate steps

No further instructions are provided here, as the run_analysis.R file is heavily commented in a step-wise manner.
