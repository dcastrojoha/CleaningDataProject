The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

----------------------FEATURES---------------------
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Subject captures the individual being measured for the above features.  Label captures the activity being performed during measurement.

The original variable names in the dataset and their replacement are as follows:

subject			subject
label			label
tBodyAcc-XYZ		Body Accelerometer(time)
tGravityAcc-XYZ		Gravity Accelerometer(time)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ	Body Accelerometer Jerk(time)
tBodyGyro-XYZ		Body Gyro(time)
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ	Body Gyro Jerk(time)
tBodyAccMag		Body Accelerometer Magnitude(time)
tGravityAccMag		Gravity Accelerometer Magnitude(time)
tBodyAccJerkMag		Body Accelerometer Jerk Magnitude(time)
tBodyGyroMag		Body Gyro Magnitude(time)
tBodyGyroJerkMag	Body Gyro Jerk Magnitude(time)
fBodyAcc-XYZ		Body Accelerometer(frequency)
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ	Body Accelerometer Jerk(frequency)
fBodyGyro-XYZ		Body Gyro(frequency)
fBodyAccMag		Body Accelerometer Magnitude(frequency)
fBodyAccJerkMag		Body Accelerometer Jerk Magnitude(frequency)
fBodyGyroMag		Body Gyro Magnitude(frequency)
fBodyGyroJerkMag	Body Gyro Jerk Magnitude(frequency)

The 'label' column was re-named to use a descriptive indicator of the label, as opposed to the original numeric indicator

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
---------------------------------------------------
-----------DATA MANIPULATIONS PERFORMED------------
Added variable names to training (X_train.txt) and test(X_test.txt) sets from features.txt
Added rows for subjects and labels to training and test sets from (y_test.txt, y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt)
Merged the two above sets via rbind and stored in 'merged'
Excluded variables that did not measure means or standard deviations via grep, and stored in merged_means_std
Renamed values for labels using the information from activity_labels.txt
Renamed variable (column) names to user-friendly descriptors via gsub function
     These steps result in output table 1: merged_means_std, which contains the tidy data set for mean and standard deviation observations across the dataset

Used dplyr to group merged_means_std by subject and label (stored in merged_means_std_grouped)
used summarise_each to apply means to the above dataset, resulting in the mean value for each observation grouped by subject and label
     These steps result in output table 2: summary
